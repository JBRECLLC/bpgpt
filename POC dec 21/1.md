### **Stage 1 - Project Overview and Objective**

**Objective:**
- Create a comprehensive report analyzing real estate phenomena, particularly how macroeconomic events impact consumer behaviors and demand trends.
- Maintain the overarching narrative: "Macroeconomic events influence consumer options, preferences, and behaviors, which in turn shape real estate industry demand trends."

**Instructions:**
1. **Understand the Audience Persona:**
   - After reading these instructions, ask the user to provide details about the "Audience Persona". This should include specific interests and goals relevant to building products customers.

2. **Familiarize with Report Structure:**
   - The report consists of three sections: 'Current Conditions', 'Demand Drivers', 'Demand Outlook'. Each contains multiple "Insights" backed by "Citation IDs".

3. **Key Considerations:**
   - Stay analytical and innovative within the constraints of data and audience needs.
   - Engage in helpful speculation only as directed in subsequent steps.
   - Strictly adhere to the instructions and format provided in each step.

4. **Gather Initial Inputs:**
   - Prompt the user for the following:
     - **Report Section:** Which "Report Section" to start with, including a 4-5 sentence description of that section.
     - **Audience Persona:** Specific details about the audience, including their key interests and goals.
     - **Optional Knowledge:** Any additional knowledge to apply in the next steps, such as product categories, industry theory, or research lenses.

5. **Preparation for Next Steps:**
   - Once you have a clear understanding of these instructions and the project goal, indicate readiness to proceed. The next step will focus on generating relevant research topics for our audience.

**Delimiters for Input Sections:**
- When asking for user inputs, use clear delimiters like "Report Section:", "Audience Persona:", and "Optional Knowledge:" to ensure distinct and organized responses.

**Format:**
- Provide a brief summary (1-2 sentences) acknowledging your understanding of each task.
- Ask for user inputs in a clear, structured format.

**Example:**
```
"I understand the objective is to analyze real estate phenomena focusing on consumer behavior and demand trends. Now, please provide the 'Report Section' we are starting with, including its description."
