**Detailed Instructions for Insight Elaboration with Data Support:**

1. **Depth of Elaboration:**
   - Elaborate on each insight using the following format:
   
   ```
   # Insight example

   ## Bullet Point: [Provide a concise bullet point that summarizes the insight]
   
   ## Insight: [Provide a clear and descriptive title for the insight]
   
   ## Report Section: [Specify the relevant report section, e.g., Demand Drivers]
   
   Explanation: [Provide a detailed explanation of the insight, including the context, factors contributing to it, and its significance. Ensure it remains data-driven and avoids speculation.]

   Supporting Data Points: [List the Citation IDs from the original data file that support this insight.]
   ```
   
   - Maintain a balance between depth and conciseness in the explanations.

2. **Data Point Integration:**
   - You have the flexibility to either elaborate on each data point individually or group and discuss them collectively.
   - Regardless of the approach, maintain a strict focus on being data-driven and avoid speculation.

3. **Contextualization:**
   - Include additional context, such as historical trends or industry benchmarks, if it can be supported by the available data without speculation.
   - Ensure that any context provided enhances the understanding of the insights and contributes to the narrative.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Stick to structured text for presenting insights; visual aids like charts or graphs are not required.

5. **Narrative Continuation:**
   - Continue building upon the narrative of how macroeconomic events influence consumer behavior and, consequently, affect demand in the real estate market with each insight.

6. **Thoroughness and Data-Driven Approach:**
   - Maintain a thorough exploration of each insight, ensuring that the supporting data points are robustly linked to the narrative.
   - Emphasize a data-driven approach throughout the elaboration process.

### Key Considerations:

- Stay strictly data-driven, avoiding speculation.
- Maintain clarity and avoid jargon.
- The narrative should illustrate how macroeconomic events influence consumer preferences and subsequent changes in demand.

Bullet: Households Increasingly Value Outdoor Living. Household preferences have shifted, driven by attitude changes following the pandemic, smaller new construction, and the lock-in affect of rising interest rates.

Insight: Households Increasingly Value Outdoor Living

Category: Demand Drivers

Explanation: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, household preferences have shifted towards an expansion of outdoor living spaces. This shift is driving spending on outdoor living products such as decks and porches. During the pandemic, homeowners spent a large portion of their time at home, a trend that has continued beyond the end of the pandemic. Two-thirds or more of young and family homeowners say that the pandemic has made their outdoor spaces more important to them. 

Higher home prices and smaller square footage per home have also led to an increased valuation of outdoor living. Homeowners are substituting indoor square footage for comfortable outdoor space, leading to an increase in purchases of decks and porches. 30% of urban homeowners would trade indoor space for a larger outdoor space. 

Rising interest rates are creating a lock-in effect where homeowners with low-rate mortgages are unlikely to move. Homeowners staying in the same home for longer encourages more upgrades to existing homes. XX% of decks and porches installed were made to homes within 2 to 4 years of their purchase date, as opposed to XX% in 2019.
