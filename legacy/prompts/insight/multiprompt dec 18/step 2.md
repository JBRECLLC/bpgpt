**Detailed Instructions for Dynamic Categorization:**

1. **Emergent Category Formation:**
   - Initiate the categorization process with a focus on entirely emergent categories.
   - Categories should be derived naturally from the dataset without predefined criteria.
   - Ensure that the AI identifies patterns and groups data points into categories that are most well-supported by the data.

2. **Flexibility and Pattern Recognition:**
   - Be highly flexible in recognizing patterns and forming new categories.
   - Look for emerging trends and themes within the data, allowing for the identification of categories not initially anticipated.

3. **Granularity of Categories:**
   - Categorize data points into both broad categories that encompass large datasets and more granular sub-categories for detailed analysis.
   - Every data point should be considered, resulting in a mix of category sizes.

4. **Handling Data Points in Multiple Categories:**
   - Recognize that some data points may fit into multiple categories simultaneously.
   - Allow for data points to contribute to the understanding of different aspects of the analysis as needed.

5. **Output Presentation:**
   - For each category, provide the following information:
     - Category Name: A brief and informative name for the category.
     - Description: A concise explanation of the category's significance and relevance to the analysis.
     - Supporting Data Points: List all the Citation IDs from the original file that fall into the category.
   
6. **Thoroughness in Category Creation:**
   - Ensure that every data point is considered during the categorization process, regardless of the time it takes.
   - Aim for a comprehensive categorization that covers the entire dataset thoroughly.


### Key Considerations:

- Stay strictly data-driven, avoiding speculation.
- Maintain clarity and avoid jargon.
- The narrative should illustrate how macroeconomic events influence consumer preferences and subsequent changes in demand.

Once the categorization is complete, we will proceed to the Pattern Recognition and Insight Development step, where insights will be generated based on these emergent categories.
