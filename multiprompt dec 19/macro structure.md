**Prompt 1 - Initial Overview and Setup:**
- Begin with an introductory message outlining the report's purpose and structure.
- Introduce the concept of exploring emergent patterns in data points and the importance of self-critique.
- Describe the "Building Products Customers" persona and its relevance.
- Set the format expectations for the report.
- Emphasize the step-by-step approach and the importance of following instructions closely.

**Prompt 2 - Request for Research Topics:**
- Ask the LLM to generate a list of research topics or questions that "Building Products Customers" would likely be interested in.
- Encourage the LLM to consider a wide range of topics related to the real estate and building products industry.
- Ensure that the research topics generated in Prompt 2 are specific and actionable. Ask the LLM to provide clear and concise research questions that directly address the needs and interests of the "Building Products Customers" persona.
- Tell the LLM to provide an "Intermediate Work" output at this stage. Intermediate work should maintain verbatim references to supporting data points.

**Prompt 3 - Explore Emergent Patterns:**
- Transition to the "Current Conditions" report section.
- Attach a file that contains the "Data Points".
- Provide "definitions": specific terms such as "dimensional lumber" and introduce key categories (e.g., demography, manufacturing, supply chain), and customer p for the LLM to consider while exploring patterns.
- Explicitly instruct the LLM to align its exploration of emergent patterns with the research topics generated in Prompt 2. This ensures that the patterns it identifies are directly relevant to the persona's interests.
- Encourage the LLM to propose patterns it identifies using the "definitions" introduced above.
- Tell the LLM to provide an "Intermediate Work" output at this stage. Intermediate work should maintain verbatim references to supporting data points.

**Prompt 4 - Self-Critique and Refinement:**
- Ask the LLM to be self-critical and identify potential limitations or counterpoints to the emergent patterns proposed in the "Current Conditions" section.
- Instruct the LLM to refine and improve the emergent patterns based on self-critique.
- Encourage the LLM to provide granular self-critique by breaking down the potential limitations or counterpoints for each emergent pattern separately. This can help in refining patterns more effectively.
- Encourage it to consider alternative explanations for the observed data.
- Reference the "Intermediate work" from the previous prompt to maintain context.
- If necessary, reiterate the definitions and key categories introduced in Prompt 2.
- Tell the LLM to provide an "Intermediate Work" output at this stage. Intermediate work should maintain verbatim references to supporting data points.

**Prompt 5 - Generate Insights Explanations:**
Start by acknowledging the emergent insights based on the refined patterns and supporting "Data Points" identified in the "Current Conditions" section.
Instruct the LLM to provide detailed explanations for each of these insights separately.
Ask the LLM to break down each insight, providing a comprehensive explanation of the observed phenomenon.
Encourage the LLM to focus on data-driven narratives, avoiding speculation, and using the "Data Points" as the primary source of information.
Ensure that the LLM maintains verbatim references to the supporting data points for each explanation.
Request that the LLM generates an "Intermediate Work" output at this stage for each insight, including the detailed explanations.
Emphasize the importance of clarity, coherence, and data-backed analysis in the explanations.

**Prompt 6 - Reduce Insights into Attention-Grabber and Description:**
- Instruct the LLM to take the identified insights and reduce them into "Insight Attention-Grabbers" (short statements) and "Insight Descriptions" (brief explanations).
- Ask for concise, clear descriptions of each insight.
- Encourage the LLM to use the refined emergent patterns, supporting "Data Points," and the introduced definitions and categories as the basis for these insights.
- Include a reference to the "Intermediate_Work_CurrentConditions" for incorporation.
- If necessary, reinforce the importance of definitions and key categories in the insight generation process.
- Tell the LLM to provide an "Intermediate Work" output at this stage. Intermediate work should maintain verbatim references to supporting data points.

**Repeat Steps 3 to 6 for Each Report Section:**
- Continue the iterative process for each report section ('Demand Drivers,' 'Demand Outlook') by repeating Steps 2 to 5 for the respective section.
