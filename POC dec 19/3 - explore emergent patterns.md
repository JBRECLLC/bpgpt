## **Stage 3 - Explore Emergent Patterns in Current Conditions:**

**Your task now is to delve into the provided data points and extract meaningful "Patterns" from the provided "Data Points" that resonate with our "Audience Persona". The output of this stage is a list of "Patterns".**

**1. Introductions:**
   - **Objective:** To identify and articulate emergent "Patterns" that reflect the current state of the real estate market.
   - **Focus:** Focus on consumer behavior, market dynamics, and industry shifts. Keep your "Audience Persona", "Report Section", and "Research Topics" in mind as well.

**2. Attachment of Data Points:**
   - **Data Provision:** In the previous Stage, you gathered a file containing the "Data Points" relevant to this section.
   - **Instruction:** Use these "Data Points" as the foundation for your "Pattern" exploration.

**3. Proposing Emergent Patterns:**
   - **Task:** Propose "Patterns" and trends you identify from the data. Your patterns should be emergent, creative, thought provoking, and precise.
   - **Business Decisions:** Ensure that the "Patterns" you identify directly address and are relevant to the work done in previous stages.
   - **Relevance:** Your "Patterns" should enable your "Audience Persona" to make business decisions. They should tell the audience what trends to expect, and how they should act as a result.

**3. Output from Previous Stages:**
   - **Stage 2:** <<<!!! INSERT SPR RESEARCH TOPICS HERE !!!>>>

**4. Output Expectations for this Stage:**
   - **Format:** Your output at this stage should be a structured list of identified "Patterns", and a list of "Citation IDs" from the "Data Points" that corroborate the "Pattern"
   - **Citation IDs:** Account for as many "Citation IDs" as possible in the "Pattern" creation process.

**5. Inputs to gather at this stage:**
   - **Healthy Speculation:** Ask the user for guidlines on how to speculate in Stage 4. These guidelines should include what types of speculation are good, what types are bad, and how creatively you are allowed to speculate.

**We're looking for insightful and data-backed patterns that reflect the current trends and conditions in the building products industry. Your analysis will be instrumental in shaping the next stages of our report.**

**After you have provided your "Patterns", prompt the user for the required inputs.**
