"""
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, household preferences have shifted towards an expansion of outdoor living spaces. This shift is driving spending on outdoor living products such as decks and porches. During the pandemic, homeowners spent a large portion of their time at home, a trend that has continued beyond the end of the pandemic. Two-thirds or more of young and family homeowners say that the pandemic has made their outdoor spaces more important to them. 

Higher home prices and smaller square footage per home have also led to an increased valuation of outdoor living. Homeowners are substituting indoor square footage for comfortable outdoor space, leading to an increase in purchases of decks and porches. 30% of urban homeowners would trade indoor space for a larger outdoor space. 

Rising interest rates are creating a lock-in effect where homeowners with low-rate mortgages are unlikely to move. Homeowners staying in the same home for longer encourages more upgrades to existing homes. XX% of decks and porches installed were made to homes within 2 to 4 years of their purchase date, as opposed to XX% in 2019.
