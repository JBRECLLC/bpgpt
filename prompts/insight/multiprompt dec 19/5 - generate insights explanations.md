## **Prompt 5 - Generate Insight Explanations for Current Conditions:**

**Building upon the refined patterns from the previous step, your task now is to develop detailed explanations for each pattern.  These explanations should be insightful, data-driven, and relevant to our 'Building Products Customers' persona. After this step, each pattern will be called "Insight".**

**1. Introduction to Insight Explanations:**
   - **Objective:** To expand each refined pattern into a detailed and coherent narrative.
   - **Focus:** Articulate how each refined pattern connects to Societal Forces and Product Categories.
   - **Outcome:** Refined patterns will become "Insights".

**2. Detailed Explanations for Each Insight:**
   - **Task:** For each Insight derived from the refined patterns, provide a comprehensive 3-5 paragraph expansion.
   - **Depth:** Each expansion should encompass the narrative arc from macroeconomic events to consumer behaviors, culminating in demand trends. It should expound data points in detail, and apply the Product Categories and Societal Forces.

**3. Narratives Characteristics:**
   - **Foundation:** Base your explanations on the "Data Points" provided.
   - **Evidence:** Seamlessly weave in specific "Data Points" as evidence  to support each part of your narrative, but do not refer to the "Citation ID" specifically.  It is encouraged that you incorporate a quote from a "Data Point" verbatim. When you do so, be sure to cite the source using the Data Point's original location.
   - **Business Decisions:** The audience should be able to make business decisions as a result of this Insight. 
   - **Relevance:** Find factual ways of integrating Product Category specific patterns into the broader narrative.
   - **Healthy Speculation:** Try to anticipate speculatory product interactions as a result of the finer points in this Insight.

**4. Previous Work:**
   - <<<!!!INPUT COMPRESSED WORK HERE!!!>>

**5. Intermediate Work Output:**
   - **Format:** Generate a separate detailed explanation for each insight. Your detailed explanation should be 3-5 paragraphs in length, drawing extensively on Product Categories and Societal Forces, as well as the attached "Data Points" file.
   - **Content:** Include a coherent narrative that is both informative and engaging.

**6. Voice and Tone:**
   - **Clarity:** Ensure that each explanation is clear and easy to understand. Adopt a prosaic tone, avoid flowerly or stilted language. Avoid SAT words. Opt for a simple, direct vocabulary.
   - **Coherence:** Maintain a logical flow in your narrative, linking supporting Data Points cohesively.
   - **Value add:** Consistently drive for information gain and value add when crafting this narrative. The audience is looking for information that they cannot find anywhere else, that sets them apart from their competition, and that they would be at a substantial disadvantage without.
   - **Confidence:** Use language that is assertive, confident, and actively voiced.

**8. Example Output:**
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, household preferences have shifted towards an expansion of outdoor living spaces. This shift is "driving spending on outdoor living products such as decks and porches" (Report.pdf, page 36). During the pandemic, homeowners spent a large portion of their time at home, a trend that has continued beyond the end of the pandemic. Two-thirds or more of young and family homeowners say that the pandemic has made their outdoor spaces more important to them. 

Higher home prices and smaller square footage per home have also led to an increased valuation of outdoor living. Homeowners are substituting indoor square footage for comfortable outdoor space, leading to an increase in purchases of decks and porches. 30% of urban homeowners would trade indoor space for a larger outdoor space. 

Rising interest rates are creating a lock-in effect where homeowners with low-rate mortgages are unlikely to move. Homeowners staying in the same home for longer encourages more upgrades to existing homes. Further, "XX% of decks and porches installed were made to homes within 2 to 4 years of their purchase date, as opposed to XX% in 2019" (Report2.pdf, page 95).

Companies in the Decks and Porches sector should anticipate needing to increas production capabilities. (more things to anticipate)
