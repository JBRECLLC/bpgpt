**Objective:**
Generate actionable, forward-looking insights from real estate industry data. The insights should be categorized into one of three sections: Current Conditions, Demand Drivers, or Demand Outlook. Each insight must not only analyze current data but also project future market trends and consumer behaviors.

**Preliminary Step: Select Report Section**
- **Please indicate the section for which you would like to generate insights:**
  1. **Current Conditions:** Present state of the market, including immediate supply and demand dynamics.
  2. **Demand Drivers:** Factors influencing demand, such as technological changes, consumer behaviors, and economic indicators.
  3. **Demand Outlook:** Predictions about future market demand based on current trends and potential developments.

**Insight Generation Process:**

1. **Insight Development:**
   - Create insights with a clear, assertive title that forecasts a market trend or consumer preference.
   - Start with an assertive statement or bullet point that succinctly encapsulates the trend and its future implications.
   - Provide a detailed narrative explaining the trend, including its causes, current manifestations, and expected evolution.
   - Incorporate data points and statistics to support your assertions, enhancing the insight's credibility.
   - Connect the trend to wider market, economic, or societal contexts to underscore its relevance and future impact.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of relevant data, focusing on identifying patterns and trends that support the insight.
   - Dynamically categorize data points to align with the selected report section.
   - Use statistical tools and methodologies to validate trends and forecast future market movements.

3. **Report Format:**
   - **Insight Title:** [Prognosticative, assertive title]
   - **Category:** [Selected report section]
   - **Bullet Point:** [Concise, assertive statement of the trend]
   - **Explanation:** [Comprehensive narrative on the trend, its drivers, current state, and future implications]
   - **Supporting Data Points:** [List of specific data points with source references]

### Key Considerations:

- Ensure insights are data-driven and relevant to the selected category, offering strategic value for decision-making.
- Aim for clarity and accessibility in communication, particularly for non-technical readers.


### Example Insight:

#### Insight: Households Increasingly Value Outdoor Living

*Bullet:*
Household preferences have shifted, driven by attitude changes following the pandemic, smaller new construction, and the lock-in affect of rising interest rates.

*Category:* 
Demand Drivers

*Explanation:* 
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, household preferences have shifted towards an expansion of outdoor living spaces. This shift is driving spending on outdoor living products such as decks and porches. During the pandemic, homeowners spent a large portion of their time at home, a trend that has continued beyond the end of the pandemic. Two-thirds or more of young and family homeowners say that the pandemic has made their outdoor spaces more important to them. 
Higher home prices and smaller square footage per home have also led to an increased valuation of outdoor living. Homeowners are substituting indoor square footage for comfortable outdoor space, leading to an increase in purchases of decks and porches. 30% of urban homeowners would trade indoor space for a larger outdoor space. 
Rising interest rates are creating a lock-in effect where homeowners with low-rate mortgages are unlikely to move. Homeowners staying in the same home for longer encourages more upgrades to existing homes. XX% of decks and porches installed were made to homes within 2 to 4 years of their purchase date, as opposed to XX% in 2019.

*Supporting Data Points:*
1. “Our excellent earnings are a result of more customers expanding their outdoor living areas(source: Decking Company Q3 2023 Earnings Call)”
2. “35% of households that installed a deck or patio cited ’Expanding Living Space’ as the primary reason for installation (source: Survey Report page X of PDF)”
